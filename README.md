Omni wheel car for sprayPal project
U kan control the car with PS2 

Omni wheels can move the robot in any direction without rotating the chassis. The robot typically supports:
Forward / backward
Sideways (strafing left/right)
Rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise)

NIce to have, but I think it is enough for this project now.
Diagonal
Combinations of translation + rotation
